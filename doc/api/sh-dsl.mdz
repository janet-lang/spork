A Domain specific language for creating shell commands and pipelines. This module complements
the @code`spork/sh` module with a terser tool for common operations. The general syntax is based
around the @code`$` macro, which can be used to run commands and collect results in a manner that
very much looks like POSIX shell, but will also work on windows.

@codeblock[janet]```
(use spork/sh-dsl)

# On posix systems, will use /bin/echo or similar to print "hello world!" and return 0, the exit code.
($ echo hello world!)

# To collect the stdout as a buffer result, use $<
($< echo hello world!)

# Same as $< but trims the last trailing newline
($<_ echo hello world!)
```

Several basic shell features are supported with nice syntax:
@ul{
    @li{Basic commands}
    @li{Environment variables}
    @li{Redirecting stdio to/from files}
    @li{Janet expressions via unquote}
    @li{Pipes}
    @li{Windows Support}
}

### Environment Variables

Environment variables can be set for commands with the usual shell syntax of ENVVAR=VALUE preceding the program name. Environment
variables from the calling process can also be passed in by passing in symbols that begin with a "$" character

@codeblock[janet]```
(use spork/sh-dsl)

# Set the JANET_PATH and invoke the janet shell
($ JANET_PATH=/home/janet-user janet -e '(print (dyn *syspath*)))

# Also works
($ JANET_PATH=$HOME -e '(print (dyn *syspath*)))
($ echo $HOME)
($ echo ,(os/getenv "HOME")) # same thing
```

Keep in mind that this syntax is not the same as Posix shell - environment variable expansion will not work everywhere and
can always be substituted with inline Janet code instead.


### Janet Substitution

Users may want to mix Janet expressions with literals when invoking subprograms, and this library makes it easy
using the familiar @code`unquote` special.

@codeblock[janet]```
(use spork/sh-dsl)

(def x 1)

# This will print "x"
($ echo x)

# This will print "1"
($ echo ,x)

# Both of these will print 6
($ echo ,(+ 1 2 3))
($ echo (+ 1 2 3))

# This will print "(+ 1 2 3)"
($ echo '(+ 1 2 3))
```
