(defn exec-slurp
  ```
  It executes args with `os/spawn` and throws an error if the process returns with non-zero exit code. If the process
  exits with zero exit code, this function trims standard output of the process and returns it. Before the function
  finishes, the spawned process is closed for resource control.
  ```
  [& args]
  # Close the process pipes. If the process pipes are not closed, janet can run out of file descriptors.
  (with [proc (os/spawn args :xp {:out :pipe})]

(defn exec-slurp-all
  ```
  It executes args with `os/spawn` and returns a struct which has the following keys.

  * `:out` - trimmed standard output of the process
  * `:err` - trimmed standard error of the process
  * `:status` - the exit code of the process

  Before the function finishes, the spawned process is closed for resource control.
